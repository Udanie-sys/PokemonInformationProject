# Back-End Coding Challenge

This is a coding exercise for new developers joining the team.

## Objective

Using TypeScript or JavaScript, your assignment is to create a database and expose it via an API with Node.js.

## Brief

We have provided you with [Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon) data in a JSON file. Your task is to create a database to store the Pokémons' information, add the data to the database, and develop an API interface to allow users to query the database and perform the following actions:

1. Get a Pokémon's data by ID
2. Get a Pokémon's data by name
3. Get a list of all Pokémons (Nice to have: Pagination)
4. Get a list of all Pokémons with different filters applied (e.g. type, weight, etc.)
5. Get all Pokémon types
6. Mark a Pokémon as favorite
7. Unmark a Pokémon as favorite
8. Get a list of all favorite Pokémons

You can use any kind of database you like (e.g. MongoDB or PostgreSQL) as well as any framework you prefer (e.g. Express or Nest.js), but please be prepared to briefly explain your design choices.

## Evaluation

We will check the following:

- Working functionalities as described
- Code architecture
- Code readability
- Implementation details
- Documentation
- Automated tests
